# 1.1 Data Science and Big Data

## what is data

## four different sources of event data
- Internet of content : classical Internet, like google
- Internet of people : social evenets generating from sns
- Internet of Things : IoT / as lots of devices are connected to the Internet
- Internet of Places : all kinds of sensors recording where and what

## Moore's law
- for 40 years, the amount of data increases by 2^20 = 1,048,576

## 4V of Big Data
- Volume : generate incredible amounts of data
- Velocity : things are chaning very rapidly and data is added in real time (live)
- Variety : many different types of data, like test, images, and sounds
- Veracity : cannot be completely sure, that what you have recoreded is completely accurate

## 4 generic data science question
- what happened? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -> about past
- why did it happen? + why was there this delay? why did people deviate from the expected path?
&nbsp;&nbsp; -> about reason
- what will happen?
&nbsp;&nbsp; -> about future
- what is the best that can happen?
&nbsp;&nbsp; -> about recommendation


# 1.2 Different Types of Process Mining

## Properties of event
- case id 
- activity : what
- timestamp : when
- resource : who

## Three types of relationship
- Play-out : start from a model, and from that model, generate behavior
&nbsp;&nbsp; -> there is a loop that are infinitely many
- Play-in : start from event data to the corresponding process model
&nbsp;&nbsp; -> infer process models from raw event data
- Replay : replay reality on top of the model
&nbsp;&nbsp; -> check where the deviations are
